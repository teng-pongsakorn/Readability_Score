# [Project: Readability Score](https://hyperskill.org/projects/39)

## About
Everyone has their own personal reading history, and as we grow up, we are able to comprehend more and more complicated texts. But how do you estimate the level of difficulty of a given text, and how do you teach a computer to do that? In this project, you will find it out: write a program that determines how difficult the text is and for which age it is most suitable.

## Learning outcomes
Learn to call programs from the command-line and get more experience with using regexes and Math class.

## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn

* **Stage 1/4: Simplest estimation**
  * Input a phrase or a sentence for the program to determine its difficulty level based on the symbol count.
* **Stage 2/4: Words and sentences**
  * Apply your knowledge of advanced strings, arrays and regular expressions: determine how difficult the text is judging by the average count of words in the sentences.
* **Stage 3/4: Score!**
  * Add a readability score based on a special formula: it will estimate the difficulty levels of larger bodies of texts uploaded from a file.
* **Stage 4/4: More parameters**
  * More parameters can be taken into account: for example, you can consider syllables and letters. Enable the program to base its estimation on those parameters altogether.
